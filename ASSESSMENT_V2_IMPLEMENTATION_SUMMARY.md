# Assessment v2 Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

The assessment system has been successfully refactored from the legacy question-based approach to a modern, versioned JSON schema system. All components have been updated and tested.

## 🔄 What Was Changed

### Database Schema
- ✅ **New tables created**: `assessment_forms`, `assessment_form_versions`, `lead_assessment_assignments`, `assessment_submissions`, `assessment_links`
- ✅ **Migration script**: `fix-question-types.sql` with complete schema and RLS policies
- ✅ **Legacy tables preserved**: Old tables remain but are no longer used

### Backend Services
- ✅ **AssessmentFormService**: Complete rewrite using new schema
- ✅ **API Routes**: All endpoints updated to use new tables
- ✅ **Validation**: JSON Schema validation with Ajv
- ✅ **Scoring**: Configurable scoring engine with weights and thresholds

### Frontend Components
- ✅ **Assessments.tsx**: Updated to show forms with versions
- ✅ **AssessmentForms.tsx**: Complete rewrite with JSON schema editor
- ✅ **LeadDetail.tsx**: Shows assessment submissions instead of risk_assessments
- ✅ **Leads.tsx**: Filters by assessment submission data
- ✅ **PublicAssessment.tsx**: Dynamic form renderer for JSON schemas

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. Version Control
- Every form save creates a new immutable version
- Full history of form changes
- Version pinning for specific leads

### 2. JSON Schema Forms
- Flexible form definitions using standard JSON Schema
- Support for multiple field types (string, number, boolean, enum)
- Built-in validation and required field handling

### 3. Configurable Scoring
- Weighted scoring system
- Customizable risk category thresholds
- Automatic score calculation on submission

### 4. Per-Lead Assignment
- Assign specific forms to leads
- Pin specific versions for stability
- Fallback to user's default form

### 5. Expiring Assessment Links
- Time-limited assessment tokens
- Per-lead or general intake links
- Automatic status tracking

## 📊 Database Tables

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `assessment_forms` | Form metadata | `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `description`, `is_active` |
| `assessment_form_versions` | Versioned schemas | `id`, `form_id`, `version`, `schema`, `ui`, `scoring` |
| `lead_assessment_assignments` | Lead-specific forms | `id`, `user_id`, `lead_id`, `form_id`, `version_id` |
| `assessment_submissions` | Completed assessments | `id`, `user_id`, `lead_id`, `form_id`, `version_id`, `answers`, `score`, `risk_category` |
| `assessment_links` | Expiring tokens | `id`, `token`, `user_id`, `lead_id`, `form_id`, `version_id`, `expires_at` |

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Apply the new schema
psql -d your_database -f fix-question-types.sql
```

### 2. Seed Initial Data
```bash
cd backend
node seed-assessment-v2.mjs
```

### 3. Verify System
```bash
cd backend
node smoke-test-assessments.mjs
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Smoke Test Status: ✅ PASSED
- Form creation and versioning
- Default form assignment
- Lead creation and form assignment
- Assessment submission (MFD and lead)
- Assessment link creation and usage
- Data integrity verification
- Cleanup and cleanup verification

All 10 test scenarios passed successfully.

## 📱 User Experience

### For MFDs (Financial Advisors)
1. **Form Builder**: JSON schema editor with live preview
2. **Version Management**: Automatic versioning on save
3. **Lead Assignment**: Assign specific forms to leads
4. **Submission Review**: Approve/reject submissions with reasons
5. **Analytics**: View scores and risk categories

### For Leads (Clients)
1. **Dynamic Forms**: Forms render based on JSON schema
2. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly assessment interface
3. **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on required fields
4. **Progress Tracking**: Clear indication of completion status

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Row Level Security**: All tables have RLS policies
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
- **Input Validation**: JSON Schema validation on all inputs
- **Token Expiry**: Assessment links expire automatically
- **Audit Trail**: Full history of form changes and submissions

## 📈 Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Database Queries**: Single table queries instead of complex joins
- **Eliminated N+1 Problems**: No more fetching questions individually
- **Better Indexing**: Optimized indexes for common query patterns
- **JSON Storage**: Efficient storage of form schemas and responses

## 🚫 Legacy System Status

### Tables No Longer Used
- ❌ `assessments` - Replaced by `assessment_forms`
- ❌ `assessment_questions` - Replaced by `assessment_form_versions.schema`
- ❌ `risk_assessments` - Replaced by `assessment_submissions`
- ❌ `risk_assessment_answers` - Replaced by `assessment_submissions.answers`

### Code No Longer Used
- ❌ Legacy question-based form builders
- ❌ Individual question CRUD operations
- ❌ Risk assessment answer storage
- ❌ Complex question-answer joins

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Form Templates**: Pre-built assessment templates
- **Advanced Scoring**: Machine learning-based scoring
- **Form Analytics**: Usage statistics and completion rates
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalized form labels
- **Conditional Logic**: Show/hide fields based on previous answers

### Technical Improvements
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed schemas
- **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications for submissions
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass form updates and migrations
