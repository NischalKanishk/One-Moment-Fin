# Risk Assessment System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the new risk assessment system for OneMFin, which provides a pluggable framework-based approach to risk scoring with support for multiple scoring engines and automatic lead generation.

## üéØ What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema
- **New Tables**: `question_bank`, `risk_frameworks`, `risk_framework_versions`, `framework_question_map`, `assessment_question_snapshots`, `assessment_submissions`
- **Updated Tables**: `assessments`, `leads` (added risk fields)
- **Migration**: Safe, idempotent migration that preserves existing data

### 2. Risk Assessment Frameworks
- **Edward Jones 6-Question 2023**: Weighted sum scoring with 5 risk bands
- **CFA Three Pillar v1**: Capacity, tolerance, and need analysis with warnings
- **DSP Style 10-Question v1**: India-focused framework with 4 risk bands
- **Nippon Style v1**: Minimalist 4-question framework with 3 risk bands

### 3. Scoring Engines
- **Weighted Sum**: Direct answer-to-score mapping with band classification
- **Three Pillar**: Multi-dimensional analysis with capacity, tolerance, and need scoring

### 4. Question Bank
- **25+ Questions**: Covering profile, capacity, knowledge, behavior, need, and constraints
- **Question Types**: Single choice, percentage, text, scale-based
- **Modular Organization**: Questions grouped by risk assessment domain

### 5. Backend Services
- **Risk Scoring Service**: Implements scoring algorithms and framework management
- **Assessment Service**: Manages assessments, snapshots, and submissions
- **API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for assessments and submissions

### 6. Frontend Components
- **AssessmentsV2**: New dashboard for managing risk frameworks and assessments
- **Public Assessment Form**: Public-facing form for lead generation
- **Framework Configuration**: UI for switching between risk assessment frameworks

## üöÄ Key Features

### Automatic Assessment Creation
- Default assessment created automatically on user signup
- Uses platform default framework (CFA Three Pillar v1)
- Published and ready for immediate use

### Framework Switching
- Users can switch between different risk assessment frameworks
- Question snapshots automatically regenerate when framework changes
- Maintains assessment history and submissions

### Lead Generation
- Public assessment forms accessible via `/a/{slug}` URLs
- Automatic lead creation from assessment submissions
- Risk profile data (bucket, score) stored with leads
- Integration with existing lead management system

### Scoring Intelligence
- Support for complex scoring algorithms
- Warning system for risk capacity vs. need mismatches
- Detailed rubric analysis for three-pillar frameworks

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### `question_bank`
- Global repository of assessment questions
- Supports multiple question types and options
- Organized by risk assessment modules

#### `risk_frameworks`
- Framework definitions with engine types
- Version control and configuration management

#### `risk_framework_versions`
- Specific versions of frameworks with JSON configs
- Support for default framework designation

#### `framework_question_map`
- Maps frameworks to specific questions
- Supports question ordering and overrides

#### `assessment_question_snapshots`
- Immutable snapshots of questions for public forms
- Ensures consistency between framework changes

#### `assessment_submissions`
- Stores assessment responses and scoring results
- Links to leads and framework versions used

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Validate Migration (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-database -f validate-migration.sql
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
```bash
# For Supabase (recommended):
psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-database -f risk-assessment-system-migration-supabase.sql

# For other PostgreSQL:
psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-database -f risk-assessment-system-migration.sql
```

### 3. Seed Framework Data
```bash
psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-database -f seed-risk-assessment-data.sql
```

### 4. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 5. Start Frontend Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Access the System
- **Dashboard**: Navigate to `/app/assessments`
- **Public Forms**: Access via `/a/{slug}` URLs
- **Legacy System**: Still available at `/app/assessments-legacy`

## üìä API Endpoints

### Assessment Management
- `GET /api/assessments/frameworks` - List available frameworks
- `POST /api/assessments` - Create new assessment
- `PATCH /api/assessments/:id` - Update assessment
- `GET /api/assessments/:id` - Get assessment details
- `GET /api/assessments/:id/submissions` - List submissions

### Public Assessment
- `GET /a/:slug` - Get public assessment form
- `POST /a/:slug/submit` - Submit assessment and create lead

### Submissions
- `GET /api/submissions/:id` - Get submission details

## üé® Frontend Usage

### For MFD Users
1. **Navigate to Assessments**: Go to `/app/assessments`
2. **Configure Framework**: Choose from available risk assessment frameworks
3. **Copy Share Link**: Use the copy button to get public assessment URLs
4. **View Submissions**: Monitor assessment submissions and leads

### For Public Users
1. **Access Form**: Visit the shared assessment link
2. **Complete Assessment**: Answer questions about financial profile
3. **Get Results**: View risk profile and recommendations
4. **Book Consultation**: Use provided CTAs for next steps

## üîÑ Workflow

### Assessment Creation Flow
1. User signs up ‚Üí Default assessment created automatically
2. Assessment uses platform default framework
3. Question snapshot generated from framework
4. Assessment published and ready for sharing

### Framework Switching Flow
1. User selects new framework in dashboard
2. System regenerates question snapshot
3. Existing submissions remain linked to old framework
4. New submissions use updated framework

### Public Submission Flow
1. User accesses public assessment form
2. Completes questions and provides contact info
3. System scores responses using current framework
4. Lead created with risk profile data
5. User sees results with next step recommendations

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
npm test
```

### Manual Testing
1. Create new user account
2. Verify default assessment creation
3. Test framework switching
4. Submit public assessment
5. Verify lead creation and risk data

## üîí Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own assessments
- Public forms accessible without authentication
- Submissions restricted to published assessments

### Data Validation
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Framework configuration validation
- Question requirement enforcement

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes
- Optimized indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient joins between framework and question tables

### Caching Strategy
- Framework configurations cached in memory
- Question snapshots stored for quick access

### Scalability
- Framework-based approach allows easy addition of new scoring methods
- Question bank supports unlimited question types
- Modular design enables independent scaling of components

## üöß Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Custom Frameworks**: Allow users to create their own frameworks
- **Advanced Scoring**: Support for machine learning-based scoring
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed insights into assessment performance
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with external risk assessment tools

### Technical Improvements
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live assessment monitoring
- **Bulk Operations**: Support for managing multiple assessments
- **Export Functionality**: Data export for compliance and reporting

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Migration Errors
- Ensure database user has sufficient privileges
- Check for existing table conflicts
- Verify PostgreSQL version compatibility

#### Framework Loading Issues
- Check framework configuration JSON syntax
- Verify question bank data integrity
- Review RLS policy configurations

#### Assessment Creation Failures
- Ensure default framework exists in database
- Check user authentication and permissions
- Verify database connection and schema

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check database connection
cd backend
node debug-db-connection.mjs

# Test assessment service
node test-assessment-service.mjs

# Verify framework data
psql -c "SELECT * FROM risk_frameworks;"
```
