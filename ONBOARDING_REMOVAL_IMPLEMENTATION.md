```

4. User can update profile details in Settings
```

## Benefits

- No extra steps after signup
- Users can start using the app immediately
- Cleaner, faster onboarding process

### ✅ Better Data Management
- All user data stored in one place (users table)
- Consistent data structure
- Easier to maintain and query

## Technical Implementation Details

### Clerk Webhook Flow
1. User signs up with Clerk
2. Clerk sends `user.created` webhook
3. Backend extracts user data from Clerk
4. Creates complete user profile in Supabase
5. Creates default user settings
6. Creates default assessment
7. Generates unique referral link

### Data Synchronization
- Frontend uses `ClerkSupabaseSync` for data consistency
- JWT tokens ensure secure database access
- RLS policies maintain data security

### Profile Updates
- Users can update profile via Settings page
- All changes go through authenticated API endpoints
- Data validation on both frontend and backend
