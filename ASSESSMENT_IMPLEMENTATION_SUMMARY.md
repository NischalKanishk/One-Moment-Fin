# Assessment Form Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the assessment form management system for OneMFin, enabling Mutual Fund Distributors (MFDs) to create, edit, and publish risk assessment forms that leads can access via referral links.

## **NEW: Automatic Default Assessment System**

### Key Improvement
Instead of creating assessment forms on-demand, the system now automatically:
1. **Creates a default assessment for every new user** when they sign up
2. **Provides 10 comprehensive risk assessment questions** out of the box
3. **Keeps assessments synchronized** when users make updates
4. **Allows easy reset to default** if users want to start over

### Benefits of New Approach
- **Immediate usability**: Users can start using assessments right after signup
- **Professional quality**: Pre-built questions cover all essential risk factors
- **Consistency**: All users start with the same high-quality assessment
- **Flexibility**: Users can still customize and modify as needed
- **No setup friction**: Eliminates the need for users to create assessments from scratch
