So what we are building is

Rahul comes to our website, Rahul is a Mutual Funds Distributor who has a lot of clients approaching him on daily basis, and it takes time for him to get back to them and analyse risk and send products accordingly. Rahul also has 4000+ leads that he wants to convert and doesnt have time to email, message, or conenct with them.
We come in here, OneMFin is a product that will automate this exact use case
A high level flow for whats happening

1. Rahul comes to OneMFin (He is one of the users of OneMFin)
2. Reads about the benefits - Signs up to the app
3. Can use phone or Email to sign up
4. He then enters the dashboard
5. He sees leads, meetings, KYC (Statusses), Users, total portfolio value
6. He has eveything empty there.
7. Rahul first has to setup everything that will include a special link that he can use everywhere
8. Rahul can customize what comes on the link (The lead form that captures, name, email, age of the lead is default and others are editable)
9. By default the link will have a Lead details, assessment form and Product descriptions (Based on risk assessment)
10. Now rahul can setup risk assessment according to him or leave it for AI
11. He can also change product suggestions according to him or let AI do the thing
12. Now whenever a person clicks on Rahul's link, they will see the form and they will enter the details. Once entered the lead will be captured in Rahul's dashboard.
13. Once the lead fills the assessment form - The AI agent will analyze the risk and then show analysis to the user. Then the user can view details and setup a meeting with Rahul
14. Once the meeting is setup - All the details are then sent to the Lead's whatsapp and is also updated in Rahul's dashboard.
15. Rahul will see the analysis when clciked on any user's details. AI agent will suggest the products that rahul can suggest to the user.
16. Rahul will then go on the app and see the meeting details of every user. Once the meeting is done, rahul has to update the status of the user on the app after the meet.
17. Additionally rahul can again send a link to the user for full KYC details, or can fill it by himself.
18. This will be a full fledged app where rahul can see data of all the users at once.
