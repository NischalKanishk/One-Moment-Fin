# User Deletion Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the user deletion functionality for OneMFin, which ensures that when a user deletes their account from Clerk, all their data is safely migrated to deprecated tables before being removed from the active system.

## Architecture

### Flow Diagram
```
User deletes account in Clerk
         ↓
Clerk sends webhook to /webhooks/clerk
         ↓
Backend processes user.deleted event
         ↓
Find user in database by clerk_id
         ↓
Migrate all user data to deprecated_* tables
         ↓
Delete user from original tables
         ↓
Data is preserved in deprecated tables
```

### Key Components

1. **Database Schema**: `deprecated_*` tables for data preservation
2. **UserDeletionService**: Core service for handling user deletion logic
3. **Clerk Webhook Handler**: Processes Clerk webhook events
4. **Admin Routes**: Administrative interface for user management
5. **Migration Function**: Database function for data migration

## Database Schema

### Deprecated Tables Structure

The system creates the following deprecated tables:

- `deprecated_users` - Main user information
- `deprecated_user_settings` - User settings and preferences
- `deprecated_leads` - User's leads data
- `deprecated_assessments` - User's assessment forms
- `deprecated_assessment_questions` - Assessment questions
- `deprecated_risk_assessments` - Risk assessment data
- `deprecated_meetings` - Meeting records
- `deprecated_user_subscriptions` - Subscription information
- `deprecated_product_recommendations` - Product recommendations
- `deprecated_ai_feedback` - AI feedback data

### Key Features

- **Data Preservation**: All user data is preserved with original references
- **Audit Trail**: Tracks deletion reason and timestamp
- **Performance**: Indexed for efficient querying
- **Cascade Deletion**: Related deprecated data is automatically cleaned up

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Migration Function

The core of the system is the `migrate_user_to_deprecated` PostgreSQL function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION migrate_user_to_deprecated(
  user_uuid UUID, 
  deletion_reason TEXT DEFAULT 'user_requested'
) RETURNS BOOLEAN
```

This function:
- Migrates user data to deprecated tables
- Handles all related data (leads, assessments, meetings, etc.)
- Provides rollback capability on failure
- Returns success/failure status

### 2. UserDeletionService

The service layer provides a clean interface for user deletion operations:

```typescript
class UserDeletionService {
  static async deleteUser(userId: string, deletionReason: string): Promise<UserDeletionResult>
  static async getDeprecatedUserData(originalUserId: string): Promise<DeprecatedUserData | null>
  static async getAllDeprecatedUsers(): Promise<DeprecatedUserData[]>
  static async restoreDeprecatedUser(deprecatedUserId: string): Promise<UserDeletionResult>
}
```

### 3. Clerk Webhook Handler

Handles Clerk webhook events at `/webhooks/clerk`:

- **user.deleted**: Triggers data migration and user deletion
- **user.updated**: Logs user updates for monitoring
- **user.created**: Logs user creation events

### 4. Admin Interface

Administrative routes at `/api/admin`:

- **GET /admin/users**: List all active users
- **DELETE /admin/users/:id**: Manually delete a user
- **GET /admin/deprecated-users**: View all deprecated users
- **POST /admin/deprecated-users/:id/restore**: Mark user as restorable

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SQL script to create deprecated tables:

```bash
psql -h your-supabase-host -U your-username -d your-database -f create-deprecated-users-database.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_clerk_webhook_secret
```

### 3. Clerk Webhook Configuration

In your Clerk Dashboard:

1. Go to **Webhooks** section
2. Create a new webhook endpoint
3. Set the endpoint URL to: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/clerk`
4. Select events: `user.deleted`, `user.updated`, `user.created`
5. Copy the webhook secret to your environment variables

### 4. Backend Deployment

The new routes are automatically included when you deploy the backend:

- `/webhooks/clerk` - Clerk webhook endpoint
- `/api/admin` - Admin management endpoints

## Testing

### 1. Run the Test Script

```bash
cd backend
node test-user-deletion.mjs
```

This script will:
- Create a test user with sample data
- Test the migration function
- Verify data preservation
- Clean up test data

### 2. Manual Testing

1. **Create a test user** in Clerk
2. **Delete the user** in Clerk
3. **Check webhook logs** in your backend
4. **Verify data migration** in deprecated tables
5. **Confirm user removal** from active tables

### 3. Webhook Testing

Use the test endpoint for development:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/webhooks/clerk/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "user.deleted", "data": {"id": "test_user_123"}}'
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Webhook Verification

- Webhook signatures are verified using Clerk's secret
- Invalid signatures are logged and can be configured to reject requests
- Production should use proper cryptographic verification

### 2. Admin Access

- Admin routes require authentication and admin role
- JWT tokens are verified for admin operations
- All admin actions are logged for audit purposes

### 3. Data Isolation

- Deprecated data is completely isolated from active users
- No cross-references between active and deprecated tables
- Original user IDs are preserved for compliance

## Monitoring and Logging

### 1. Log Levels

- **INFO**: Successful operations, webhook receipts
- **WARN**: Non-critical issues (user not found, etc.)
- **ERROR**: Critical failures, migration errors

### 2. Key Metrics

- User deletion success rate
- Data migration completion time
- Webhook processing latency
- Deprecated data storage usage

### 3. Health Checks

- `/webhooks/clerk/health` - Webhook endpoint health
- `/api/admin/health` - Admin endpoint health
- `/api/admin/stats` - System statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not received**
   - Check Clerk webhook configuration
   - Verify endpoint URL accessibility
   - Check webhook secret in environment

2. **Migration failures**
   - Check database permissions
   - Verify table structure
   - Check for data integrity issues

3. **User not found**
   - Verify clerk_id mapping
   - Check user table structure
   - Ensure proper authentication

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check webhook endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/webhooks/clerk/health

# Check admin endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/api/admin/health

# View deprecated users (requires admin auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/admin/deprecated-users
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Database Optimization

- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Batch operations for large data migrations
- Efficient cascade deletion

### 2. Webhook Processing

- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Queue system for high-volume scenarios

### 3. Storage Management

- Regular cleanup of old deprecated data
- Compression for archived data
- Monitoring of storage usage

## Compliance and Legal

### 1. Data Retention

- Deprecated data is preserved for compliance
- Deletion timestamps for audit trails
- Reason tracking for legal requirements

### 2. GDPR Considerations

- User data is completely removed from active system
- Historical data preserved for business requirements
- Clear audit trail of deletion process

### 3. Business Continuity

- No data loss during user deletion
- Complete isolation of deleted user data
- Ability to restore data if needed

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Automated Cleanup

- Scheduled cleanup of old deprecated data
- Configurable retention periods
- Automated archiving to cold storage

### 2. Enhanced Restoration

- Full user restoration capability
- Data validation during restoration
- Conflict resolution for restored data

### 3. Analytics and Reporting

- Deletion pattern analysis
- Data migration metrics
- Compliance reporting

## Support and Maintenance

### 1. Regular Monitoring

- Monitor webhook delivery rates
- Check database performance
- Review error logs

### 2. Updates and Patches

- Keep Clerk SDK updated
- Monitor for security updates
- Regular dependency updates

### 3. Backup and Recovery

- Regular backups of deprecated data
- Test restoration procedures
- Document recovery processes
